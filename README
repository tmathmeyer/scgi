SCGI (is it Slow or Stupid, you decide!)
========================================
a shitty mock CGI host, because installing the other ones took too much effort.
also kindof a reverse proxy, but not really.

INSTALLATION (linux supported only)
===================================
run make
copy build/scgi to your path somewhere

USAGE
=====
scgi -p [port] -c [config/file/path]

CONFIG
======
the config file consists of lines that match:
[host][whitepsace][binary][newline]
such as (yes I know there are mixed tabs and spaces here)
127.0.0.1                  /usr/bin/sneaky.sh
when a request comes in, if the host that the request used matches
one of the hosts in the config file, the binary provided will be
executed with the data from the request in environment variables.
you can also use DEFAULT in place of a host, and any unmatched traffic
will have the corresponding binary executed.
